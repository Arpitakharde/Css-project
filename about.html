            <P>A bakery is an establishment that produces and sells flour-based baked goods made in an oven such as
                bread, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, bagels, pastries, and pies. Some retail bakeries are also categorized
                as cafés, serving coffee and tea to customers who wish to consume the baked goods on the premises. In
                some countries, a distinction is made between bakeries, which primarily sell breads, and pâtisseries,
                which primarily sell sweet baked goods.</P>
